## Booting Pintos

>A1: Put the screenshot of Pintos running example here.



## Debugging

#### QUESTIONS: BIOS 

>B1: What is the first instruction that gets executed?

The first instruction seems to be `sub %ax, %ax` in the loader.S


>B2: At which physical address is this instruction located?

The loader should put it at 0x7c00.


#### QUESTIONS: BOOTLOADER

>B3: How does the bootloader read disk sectors? In particular, what BIOS interrupt is used?

Bootloader reads disk sector in the `read_sector` subroutine. It takes a drive number in %dl and a sector number in %ebx, and reads the specified sector into memory at ES:0000. The read_mbr subroutine set %es to 0x2000. The physical address ES:0000 would be calculated as `(0x2000 << 4) + 0x0000 = 0x20000`. The CF of 1 indicates that errors occurred while reading.

The `int $0x13` instruction invokes the BIOS interrupt handler for disk services.

The `int $0x14` instruction is used for printing communication messages.

The `int $0x18` interrupt is issued if the boot failed because no bootable partition was found (in here).

>B4: How does the bootloader decides whether it successfully finds the Pintos kernel?

We read up to 512 kB from the disk (the disk needs to be MBR partitioned), %cx register is used to keep track of the number of sectors read (up to 1024 since each sector is of 512 bytes). If the read was successful, we calculate the memory location of the start function and jump to it. The address is stored in memory, so we employ an indirect long jump.

>B5: What happens when the bootloader could not find the Pintos kernel?

The `int $0x18` interrupt is issued if the boot failed.

>B6: At what point and how exactly does the bootloader transfer control to the Pintos kernel?

When the kernel was successfully read and after estimating location of the start function `ljmp *start`.

#### QUESTIONS: KERNEL

>B7: At the entry of pintos_init(), what is the value of expression `init_page_dir[pd_no(ptov(0))]` in hexadecimal format?



>B8: When `palloc_get_page()` is called for the first time,

>> B8.1 what does the call stack look like?
>>
>> 

>> B8.2 what is the return value in hexadecimal format?
>>
>> 

>> B8.3 what is the value of expression `init_page_dir[pd_no(ptov(0))]` in hexadecimal format?
>>
>> 



>B9: When palloc_get_page() is called for the third time,

>> B9.1 what does the call stack look like?
>>
>> 

>> B9.2 what is the return value in hexadecimal format?
>>
>> 

>> B9.3 what is the value of expression `init_page_dir[pd_no(ptov(0))]` in hexadecimal format?
>>

## Kernel Monitor

>C1: Put the screenshot of your kernel monitor running example here. (It should show how your kernel shell respond to `whoami`, `exit`, and `other input`.)

#### 

>C2: Explain how you read and write to the console for the kernel monitor.
